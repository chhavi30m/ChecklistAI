# ChecklistAI
A playaround with the OpenAI API to prompt engineer for creating checklists on virtually anything.<br>
This was my first attempt at prompt engineering using OpenAI's API. <br>
<p>Given the versatility of ChatGPT's LLM, it was interesting to prompt engineer using dozens of attempts to output a concise checklist with keywords.</p>
<p>I tried it with all kinds of attempts, from checklisting creation of a Spotify playlist to organizing Google Chrome. This acts as a double, posing as a guide for straightforward prompts.</p>
<h3> Limitations </h3>
<p>There are some limitations, however. This version that I designed does not account for an extremely dynamic change in ChatGPT answers. String operations in this version are designed so that it works with the engineered prompt, however, it might deviate for some prompts.</p>

<h4>That being said, feel free to run your own prompts!</h4>
